He is able to play on either wing as well through the center of the pitch, making him a versatile attacker, capable of playing in any offensive position. From a tactical standpoint, he usually plays in a freerole, often drifting from the left wing into the centre when moving off the ball. Ronaldo is known to be mentally sharp, with good vision and positioning, often predicting certain plays; he also possesses quick reactions, opportunism, balance, and agility. Although right-footed, he is also able tocontrol the ball, cross, and finish well with his left foot.Ronaldo is known for his technical skill, control and dribbling ability, as well as his flair in beating player during one on one situations. A prolific goalscorer, he is able to finish well both inside the area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot.
